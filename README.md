# nfl-news-generator

I wanted to learn how to generate composite images using Javascript and Canvas, so I humbly present the NFL News Generator. 

A working version can be found at https://32-teams.com. 

The project integrates form fields that dynamically update the associated image with generated text, icons or colors. The image can then be downloaded.
